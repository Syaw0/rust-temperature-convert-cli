# Rust Temperature Convert CLI

A simple command-line interface (CLI) application written in Rust to convert temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## Overview

This project is a practical learning exercise to demonstrate my understanding of Rust programming concepts, including:

- Controlling program flow using `loop` and `match` statements
- Handling errors and exceptions
- Validating inputs properly
- Building a CLI application using Rust's standard library

## Features

- Convert temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius
- Convert temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit
- Simple and intuitive command-line interface

## Getting Started

To use this application, simply compile and run the code using Rust's `cargo` tool.

## Usage

- Run the application using `cargo run`
- Follow the prompts to convert temperature between Fahrenheit and Celsius

## Future Development

This project is a starting point for further learning and development. Future features may include:

- Adding support for other temperature units (e.g., Kelvin)
- Implementing more advanced error handling and validation
- Improving the user interface and experience
